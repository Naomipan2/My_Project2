My Project for Sprint4

This project is about running an app locally. First, we will need to install a stream in our system to build an app. I'm using VS code to do all the Python coding scripts. Then, type "streamlet run app1.py" in the terminal to see whether the app is working or not. 

Second, I need to have a file for the requirements to run the code and a folder "config.toml" to be able to connect the streamlit. 

Finally, I would need to have a README file to add the project description and link, which would make it easier for whoever reviews the project. Then deploy to the website called "Render".

About the description of the project: This project discusses the prices of different manufacturers and vehicle types to give advice to car-selling companies, including how many advertisements are used. We used a Bar Plot to see each manufacturer's price range for different vehicle types. Using a histogram for both car conditions and the model of the year, compare price distribution between manufacturers.

Price Distribution by Manufacturer (BMW vs. Ford): The distribution shows that Ford vehicles have a wider spread of lower prices compared to BMW, indicating that Ford vehicles are generally priced lower and more variably. On the other hand, BMW has a smaller range of higher prices.

Condition vs. Model Year: Most vehicles from more recent model years (2000 onwards) are in "good" or "excellent" condition, with older cars less represented. Few cars from earlier decades appear in the "new" or "like new" conditions.

Vehicle Types by Manufacturer: The plot shows the price distribution by vehicle type across different manufacturers. For example, Ford and Chevrolet dominate in pickups, while SUVs are prevalent across many brands.

Car Sales Data (BMW): The table provides specific listings for BMW vehicles, including model type, price, year, condition, and other specs like fuel type and odometer readings.

These visualizations comprehensively understand the market distribution, conditions, and pricing across various manufacturers and vehicle types. They also highlight the differences in price ranges between brands, conditions based on model years, and the prevalence of vehicle types by manufacturer.
