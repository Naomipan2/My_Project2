My Project for Sprint4
https://app1.py.onrender.com/
This project is about running an app locally. First, we will need to install a stream in our system to build an app. I'm using VS code to do all the Python coding scripts. Then, type "streamlet run app1.py" in the terminal to see whether the app is working or not. 

Second, I need to have a file for the requirements to run the code and a folder "config.toml" to be able to connect the streamlit. 

Finally, I would need to have a README file to add the project description and link, which would make it easier for whoever reviews the project. Then deploy to the website called "Render".

About the description of the project: This project discusses the prices of different manufacturers and vehicle types to give advice to car-selling companies, including how many advertisements are used. We used a Bar Plot to see each manufacturer's price range for different vehicle types. Using a histogram for both car conditions and the model of the year, compare price distribution between manufacturers.
